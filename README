# gstreamer1.0-plugin-multibox-dvbmediasink
This git is based on pli4 git://git.code.sf.net/p/openpli/gst-plugin-dvbmediasink Branch gst-1.0
It adds support for more boxes then only the et stb's.
Boxes which currently should be ok are:
vuplus series, dm8000 and dm800se
alias : christophecvr
stefansat@telenet.be

An example off bb file is added.

This is the one I use in meta-oe-alliance

How to use :  READ REMARK !

Some xtrend boxes need a max pcm rate off 48000.
For those boxes add --with-max-pcmrate-48K

Examples configs :

dreambox dm800se : DVBMEDIASINK_CONFIG = "--with-machine=${MACHINE} --with-pcm --with-wma --with-wmv --with-dtsdownmix --with-eac3"
dreambox dm8000  : DVBMEDIASINK_CONFIG = "--with-machine=${MACHINE} --with-pcm --with-wma --with-wmv --with-dtsdownmix --with-eac3 --with-amr --with-limited-mpeg4v2"
vuplus           : DVBMEDIASINK_CONFIG = "--with-machine=${MACHINE} --with-pcm --with-eac3 --with-amr --with-wmv"

REMARK :

Currently works are started to simplify the DVBMEDIASINK_CONFIG based on MACHINE parameter.
This containes the right stb box group for the mediasink The list can be consulted into the Makefile of meta-alliance.
